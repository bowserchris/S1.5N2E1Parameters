Using previous exercises with parameters for the directory path and file path, whilst creating a java properties file.

Steps to run Java programs in CMD window. Be aware of whitespaces within
folder names as the CMD window might not recognize them and find errors. 
The same applies to the files; e.g. 'Hey There.java' wonÂ´t be recognized
but 'HeyThere.java' will work.

1) Go to the windows button, or press the windows key, and type in
'cmd' to open the command window.
2) Find the directory the file is located,copy the file path, and 
type 'cd ' with the whitespace and then introduce the directory path.
This will put the CMD window in that folder to view those files within it.
3) In order to compile the code, type in 'javac' and then the name 
of the file with '.java' at the end of the file. This will create a .class 
file of the program in the directory specified. You can now run it directly
through this file. For this exercise, the whole thing with the main is 'javac App.java'
4) To finally run the file thru the CMD window type in 'java ', with the
whitespace, and then the file name without the '.java' suffix and if there
are no errors it will run successfully. For this exercise, the whole thing with the main is 'java App'

Easy steps below
1)Window button, type 'cmd'
2)type 'cd ' then copy in directory path: e.g. C:\Users\user\eclipse-workspace\....
3)type 'javac ' then document file with .java: e.g. 'hello.java'
4)type 'java '  then document file without .java: e.g. 'hello'
Program will run if no errors.
